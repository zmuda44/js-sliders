always keep in mind on the css that 
you can control the width of an image to a container by setting image 100%. you can control the height as well,
you just need to watch out for stretching.

i am trying to create this so that orange box takes up the same height and width as the parent ofall 
images.  i think i would set the container height and width properties and then use overflow: hidden
problem is with that is that i also want the height and width of the container to be the bounding box.
i want anything aftewards to behave like that's the block element. i dont want the image sticking out 
the bottom in any way. maybe some sort of background0clip? maybe learn mroe about cover position. can 
you do that with images or just background images?

have the original code with the images already in it in your one notes

js behavior:
starts out with slideIndex set to 1 and then
immediately calls the function showSlides. this means 
that on page load this function immediately runs. 
is that what this is doing? can you call a fucntion before
you define it?

try writing this with event listeners. i think the reason
they dont write the entire function under the button click
(this is what you had been doing before, but there
was only 1 button.  this time a button is an input (variable) in a larger equation)

the button gives a button to the function showSlides originally. this is a dyanmic variable to the bigger equation show showSlides

show slides function declars the variable i (i wonder if you need to do this?)
they also set the if statements outside the for loop (before it)

the way it gets bound is through defining slides with something
plural (queryAll or elementS by class name)
then reference the array with the slides index
